<h2 align="center" id="the-game">:video_game: The Game :video_game:</h2>
<p align="center">The <a href="https://felipepds.github.io/Snake-Game">game</a> consists of the classic snake game :snake:, where the objective is to collect as much fruit :apple: as possible, increasing its tail until it collides with something that will end the game. However in this game it is possible to customize the game mode, the difficulty and the stylization.</p>

<br>

<h2 align="center" id="development-project">Development Project</h2>
<p align="center">Developed with javascript, css and html, it was structured in objects, where some values vary their state, or the user can change it in the settings. <br> Its structure (in which the game is formed) was briefly as follows:</p>

``` javascript
const game = {
    global: {
        
    },
    
    status: {
    
    },
    
    entities: {
    
    },
    
    commands: {
    
    },
    
    settings: {
    
    },
    
    events: {
    
    }
}
```
